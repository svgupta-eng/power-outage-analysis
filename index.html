        <h1>Power Outage Analysis</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    Our dataset contains detailed information on power outages across different U.S. states, with each row 
    representing a single outage event. These events include when the outage began, how long it lasted, how many 
    customers were affected, and what factors contributed to the disruption. Understanding this dataset is important 
    because power outages are becoming increasingly common due to aging infrastructure, extreme weather, and rising 
    energy demands. By examining outage patterns, we can better understand which factors contribute most to 
    disruptions and potentially identify ways to reduce their impact on communities.
    </p>

    <p>
    The central question guiding this project is: <strong>Which factors are most strongly associated with longer 
    power outage durations?</strong> This question matters because outage duration directly affects public safety, 
    economic loss, and community resilience. If we can understand what drives long outages, decision-makers can 
    better prepare and respond to emergencies.
    </p>

    <p>The dataset contains <strong>1534 rows</strong>. The relevant columns for this question are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>OUTAGE.START</strong> — The start date and time of the outage event.</li>
        <li><strong>OUTAGE.DURATION</strong> — The length of the outage in minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED</strong> — Estimated number of customers impacted.</li>
        <li><strong>CAUSE.CATEGORY</strong> — High-level category describing the primary cause of the outage.</li>
        <li><strong>CAUSE.SUBCATEGORY</strong> — More specific details about the cause.</li>
        <li><strong>CLIMATE.REGION</strong> — The assigned climate region for the state in which the outage occurred.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    These initial observations help motivate deeper analysis into which factors are truly connected to longer 
    outage durations.
    </p>


    <h2>Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>
    Before analyzing the dataset, several cleaning steps were necessary to ensure accuracy and consistency. First, 
    rows containing header information and unrelated metadata were removed so the dataset included only valid 
    outage records. Placeholder values such as <code>--</code>, <code>Unknown</code>, and <code>N/A</code> were replaced with proper 
    missing values to prevent incorrect interpretation during analysis. Numeric columns such as <code>YEAR</code>, 
    <code>MONTH</code>, <code>POPULATION</code>, and <code>OUTAGE.DURATION</code> were converted to numeric types, with invalid values coerced 
    to missing where appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
    Next, the outage start date and time were combined into a single <code>OUTAGE.START</code> column to reflect the full 
    timestamp of each event. Redundant columns such as <code>OUTAGE.START.DATE</code> and <code>OUTAGE.START.TIME</code> were then 
    removed. Additionally, an <code>URBANIZATION</code> variable was created by combining <code>POPPCT_URBAN</code> and 
    <code>POPPCT_UC</code> to give a more comprehensive understanding of the urban population share in each state.
    </p>

    <p>
    These data cleaning steps ensured the dataset was well-structured and ready for exploratory analysis. Below, we 
    present both univariate and bivariate visualizations, as well as grouped summaries, to explore how various 
    factors relate to outage duration and outage characteristics across states and causes.
