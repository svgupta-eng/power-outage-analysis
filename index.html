        <h1>Power Outage Analysis</h1>
        <p class="creators">By Sana Gupta & Aarushi Jain</p> 
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    Our dataset contains detailed information on power outages across different U.S. states, with each row 
    representing a single outage event. These events include when the outage began, how long it lasted, how many 
    customers were affected, and what factors contributed to the disruption. Understanding this dataset is important 
    because power outages are becoming increasingly common due to aging infrastructure, extreme weather, and rising 
    energy demands. By examining outage patterns, we can better understand which factors contribute most to 
    disruptions and potentially identify ways to reduce their impact on communities.
    </p>

    <p>
    The central question guiding this project is: <strong>Which factors are most strongly associated with longer 
    power outage durations?</strong> This question matters because outage duration directly affects public safety, 
    economic loss, and community resilience. If we can understand what drives long outages, decision-makers can 
    better prepare and respond to emergencies.
    </p>

    <p>The dataset contains <strong>1534 rows</strong>. The relevant columns for this question are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>OUTAGE.START</strong> — The start date and time of the outage event.</li>
        <li><strong>OUTAGE.DURATION</strong> — The length of the outage in minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED</strong> — Estimated number of customers impacted.</li>
        <li><strong>CAUSE.CATEGORY</strong> — High-level category describing the primary cause of the outage.</li>
        <li><strong>CAUSE.SUBCATEGORY</strong> — More specific details about the cause.</li>
        <li><strong>CLIMATE.REGION</strong> — The assigned climate region for the state in which the outage occurred.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    These initial observations help motivate deeper analysis into which factors are truly connected to longer 
    outage durations.
    </p>


    <h2>Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>
    Before analyzing the dataset, several cleaning steps were necessary to ensure accuracy and consistency. First, 
    rows containing header information and unrelated metadata were removed so the dataset included only valid 
    outage records. Placeholder values such as <code>--</code>, <code>Unknown</code>, and <code>N/A</code> were replaced with proper 
    missing values to prevent incorrect interpretation during analysis. Numeric columns such as <code>YEAR</code>, 
    <code>MONTH</code>, <code>POPULATION</code>, and <code>OUTAGE.DURATION</code> were converted to numeric types, with invalid values coerced 
    to missing where appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
    Next, the outage start date and time were combined into a single <code>OUTAGE.START</code> column to reflect the full 
    timestamp of each event. Redundant columns such as <code>OUTAGE.START.DATE</code> and <code>OUTAGE.START.TIME</code> were then 
    removed. Additionally, an <code>URBANIZATION</code> variable was created by combining <code>POPPCT_URBAN</code> and 
    <code>POPPCT_UC</code> to give a more comprehensive understanding of the urban population share in each state.
    </p>

    <p>
    These data cleaning steps ensured the dataset was well-structured and ready for exploratory analysis. Below, we 
    present both univariate and bivariate visualizations, as well as grouped summaries, to explore how various 
    factors relate to outage duration and outage characteristics across states and causes.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Outages by Month</h3>
    <iframe src="assets/outages_by_month.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>
    This bar chart shows how outages are distributed across the year, with clear peaks in summer months like June and July, when heat and higher energy demand put extra stress on the grid.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Outages by Climate Region</h3>
    <iframe src="assets/outages_by_climate_region.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>
    This plot compares outage frequency across climate regions and shows that the Northeast and some southern and western regions experience more outages, reflecting differences in weather patterns and infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Population by Outage Cause</h3>
    <iframe src="assets/population_by_cause.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>
    This boxplot shows that outages from system operability issues and fuel supply emergencies tend to affect states with larger populations, while causes like intentional attacks and severe weather skew toward smaller or less urban states.
    </p>

<h2>Assessment of Missingness</h2>
    <p>
    We believe that the <strong>CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED</strong> column is likely <strong>NMAR</strong> (Not Missing At Random). 
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Reasoning:</strong> The missingness in this column is likely dependent on the missing value itself. 
    Utility companies and federal agencies are more rigorous about recording data for massive, high-impact events. 
    If an outage affects a very small number of people, it may not trigger the reporting threshold required by 
    department of energy guidelines, or the utility might simply prioritize restoring power over precise clerical documentation 
    for minor events. Therefore, the probability of the value being missing increases as the actual number of customers affected decreases. 
    Because the missingness depends on the value of the data we typically cannot see, this falls under NMAR.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Additional Data:</strong> To transform this from NMAR to MAR (Missing At Random), we would want to obtain 
    data regarding the <strong>reporting policies and minimum thresholds</strong> of the specific utility companies involved. 
    If we had a dataset showing that "Utility Company X only reports outages affecting >500 customers," we could explain 
    the missingness using that observed variable.
    </p>

<h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
    <p>
    To understand if the timing of outages correlates with their severity, we performed a permutation test 
    to analyze the relationship between the month of the outage and its duration.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> The average outage duration is the same for outages occurring in odd-numbered months 
    and even-numbered months. Any observed difference is due to random chance.</p>

    <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> The average outage duration differs between odd-month and even-month outages.</p>

    <p>
    <strong>Test Statistic:</strong> The difference in mean outage duration between the two groups (Mean of Odd Months - Mean of Even Months).
    We chose this statistic because it is a direct measure of the magnitude of difference between the two distributions.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Significance Level:</strong> 0.05
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Resulting P-value:</strong> 0.318
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> 
    Since the p-value (0.318) is greater than the significance level (0.05), we <strong>fail to reject the null hypothesis</strong>. 
    This suggests that the "parity" of the month (whether it is odd or even) does not have a statistically significant 
    association with the duration of power outages. This result is consistent with our intuition, as month parity is an 
    arbitrary calendar feature rather than a physical or environmental factor likely to influence power grid stability.
    </p>

    <h3>Permutation Test Distribution</h3>
    <p>The histogram below shows the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis, with the red line indicating our observed statistic.</p>
